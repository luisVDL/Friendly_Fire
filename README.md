# Friendly_Fire

## Project Description
This is a personal project I made with some friends. The project is in the demo stage and there are no future updates planned.
- I designed the map, the game loop, the enemies, most of the "Friends" mechanics and the wave system.
- I programmed the wave system, the enemies AI which had a NavMeshAgent adaptation for 2D environments via plugin, the player, the "Friends" abilities and the UI (everything).
- I created the enemies sprites and animations, the environment tilemap, the player sprites and animations, and some of the "Friends" sprites and animations.
